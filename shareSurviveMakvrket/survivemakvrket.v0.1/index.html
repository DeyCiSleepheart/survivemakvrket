<h1>Survive Makvärket</h1>
<h2>Hi! This is a gametest demo</h2>
<h3>to show what a wonderful idea it is to make a game out of Makvärket and to convince you to help along making it.</h3>

<p>It is a very short presentation and most of the directions are dead ends. It will take a fairly long and difficult time to make it a proper game, but I really believe that it could be awesome and grow with time.</p>
